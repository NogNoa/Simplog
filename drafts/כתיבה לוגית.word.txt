Objects
∀O -all O, a universel. the object of all objects with whatever qualification or predicate.
O∈∀O an instance of a universal. 
O:P - O such that P - an object that is qulified by a propistion. Itself an object.
O(O) - Object that is dependant on another object.

Propositions
P⇒P - if P then P - a propostion follows from a propostion. Itself a proposition.
P⇔P- P if and only if P - two proposition follow from each other and therfore are equivalent.
O;P - for O it's true that P - a proposition that assumes an object, itself a proposition.
∃O- O exists - a object with whatever qulification or predicate exists.

Moods 
let {P} - a proposition is imperativly stated as true, with existential import.
sup {P} - making a supposition that could turn out to be false later. Could be indexd for referance sup1 {P}, sup2 {P}.
asm {P} - a proposition, or series of propositions, are true if all our assumption are true.
asm_n {P} - a proposition is true if suppostion n is true.
true {P} -  a proposition, or series of propositions is true from all we are certain about.
contra {n⇐P}- an assumtion n is false due to a contradictory proposition p that follows from n.
def {O|P} defines Object O by imperativly stating a proposition P as true.
ntte {O=O} notating object by another object 
true could be omitted.
