Objects:
O		    # A general Object.
I           # An individual Object
O:P         # An object for which P is ‎True
\A\ O:P     # Any object for which P

Sets:
S		    # A simple Set
{O}_s       # The set that includes O and only it.
SחS         # The set of all objects that are in both S and S
S:P 	    # The set of all objects that are in S, and for which P is ‎True.

Propositions:
P           # A simple Proposition.
O;P 	    # Claiming that for object O, P is true.
OεS         # Claiming that O is in S
\E\ O	    # Claiming that an object O exists.
P /=> P     # Claiming that if P than P.
P <=> P     # Claiming that P if and only if P.

Moods:
LET {O} 	# Introducing O. Existance is imperativly implied.
LET {P} 	# Imperativly claiming P.
DEF {O}	name
DEF {S}	name  # Introducing O or S. the syntax of O or S is expected to end with or at least include ':P'. Existance is imperativly implied.
{P} 		# Claiming P, relying on what was already Known.
PRV {P}		# expect everything until QED to be what P is relying on, i.e the proof for P.
ASM {P} name  # Introducing P as assumption without claiming it. P get a name.
SUP {P}		# Claiming P as supposition, relying on all preceding assumptions. 
SUP {P} name  # Claiming P, relying on a named assumption. 
            # When an assumption is discarded, all relient suppositions are discarded.
CNT {P}		# Concluding that P is a contradiction. expects next line to claim an assumption False.
FLS name	# Claiming an assumption is False. discarding it
DSC name    # Discards an assumption without falsifaing it.
QED			# End of proof. P in the PRV statement is claimed and every assumption inside the proof is discarded.
CRL {P}	    # After QED, claiming a SUPposed proposition as corollary from the proof, thus saving it from being discarded.
NTT {O \== O}
NTT {S \== S} # Imperativly introducing an equivalent way to refer to an object or set already introduced.

Order of Operations:
Mathematical operators are more internal than logical.
Unary operations are more most internal
Operations between two objects or sets more internal than operations between one of those and a proposition
: more internal than ;
oprations between an object or set and a proposition more internal than  operations between two propositions
operator of equal place in the order the right are more internal than the left

a phrase of the kind X:P or S:P where P is simple, made of only 3 characters: subject, binary operator and operand, where the subject is the X or the P of the bigger phrase, this subject could be omited from P. for instance
    X:XεS \== X:εS
    S:S=S_1 \== S:=S_1 (not to be confused with defined)
    this never happens with unary or potentialy unary operators (-,\not, \E\, \A\)
